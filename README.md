# FLATDANGO

Flatiron Movie Theater is open for business! I am building out an
application, Flatdango, that allows a user to purchase movie tickets from the
theater.

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I can:

1. See the first movie's details, including its **poster, title, runtime,
   showtime, and available tickets** when the page loads. The number of
   available tickets will need to be derived by subtracting the number of
   `tickets_sold` from the theater's `capacity`.
2. See a menu of all movies on the left side of the page in the `ul#films`
   element when the page loads. (_optional_: you can style each film in the list
   by adding the classes `film item` to each `li` element.) There is a
   placeholder `li` in the `ul#films` element that is hardcoded in the HTML â€”
   feel free to remove that element by editing the HTML file directly, or use
   JavaScript to remove the placeholder element before populating the list.
